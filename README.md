# Telemetry decoder for the AztechSat-1


This project was developed to decode AztechSat-1 telemetry data. The satellite was launched in February 2019 by UPAEP (Universidad Aut√≥noma del Estado de Puebla) and remained functional until December 2021. The emitted data from the satellite was collected and processed. An analysis of the collected data was published and can be consulted here: https://doi.org/10.3390/aerospace10110973
